  "readme": "# BitcoinJS (bitcoinjs-lib)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib)\n[![tip for next commit](http://tip4commit.com/projects/735.svg)](http://tip4commit.com/projects/735)\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/bitcoinjs-lib.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/bitcoinjs-lib/)\n\nThe pure JavaScript Bitcoin library for node.js and browsers.\nA continued implementation of the original `0.1.3` version used by over a million wallet users; the backbone for almost all Bitcoin web wallets in production today.\n\n\n## Features\n\n- Clean: Pure JavaScript, concise code, easy to read.\n- Tested: Coverage > 90%, third-party integration tests.\n- Careful: Two person approval process for small, focused pull requests.\n- Compatible: Works on Node.js and all modern browsers.\n- Powerful: Support for advanced features, such as multi-sig, HD Wallets.\n- Secure: Strong random number generation, PGP signed releases, trusted developers.\n- Principled: No support for browsers with crap RNG (IE < 11)\n- Standardized: Node community coding style, Browserify, Node's stdlib and Buffers.\n- Fast: Optimized code, uses typed arrays instead of byte arrays for performance.\n- Experiment-friendly: Bitcoin Mainnet and Testnet support.\n- Altcoin-ready: Capable of working with bitcoin-derived cryptocurrencies (such as Dogecoin).\n\n\n## Should I use this in production?\n\nIf you are thinking of using the master branch of this library in production, *stop*.\nMaster is not stable; it is our development branch, and only tagged releases may be classified as stable.\n\nIf you are looking for the original, it is tagged as `0.1.3`. Unless you need it for dependency reasons, it is strongly recommended that you use (or upgrade to) the newest version, which adds major functionality, cleans up the interface, fixes many bugs, and adds over 1,300 more tests.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install bitcoinjs-lib`\n\n\n## Setup\n\n### Node.js\n\n    var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')\n\n\n### Browser\n\nIf you're familiar with how to use browserify, ignore this and proceed normally.\nThese steps are advisory only and allow you to use the API to its full extent.\n\n[Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) is assumed to be installed for these steps.\n\nFrom your repository, create a `foobar.js` file\n\n``` javascript\nvar foobar = {\n  base58: require('bs58'),\n  bitcoin: require('bitcoinjs-lib'),\n  ecurve: require('ecurve'),\n  BigInteger: require('bigi'),\n  Buffer: require('buffer')\n}\n\nmodule.exports = foobar\n```\n\nEach of these included packages are seperate to `bitcoinjs-lib`, and must be installed separately.\nThey are however used in the bitcoinjs-lib public API.\n\nUsing browserify, compile `foobar.js` for use in the browser:\n\n    $ browserify foobar.js -s foobar > foobar.js\n\nYou will then be able to load `foobar.js` into your browser, with each of the dependencies above accessible from the global `foobar` object.\n\n**NOTE**: See our package.json for the currently supported version of browserify used by this repository.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThe below examples are implemented as integration tests, they should be very easy to understand.
